# Social Media Dashboard

The goal is to build a Social Media Dashboard based on the style guide and design resources.
It should:
-   Use **TypeScript** and **React** best practices
-   Be responsive and consistent
-   Have hover states
-   Toggle color theme to their preference
    -   Persist this setting in localStorage
-   Allow the cards to be rearranged (Drag & Drop) and persist the location to localStorage
-   Be clean and maintainable
-   Test enough where it matters
