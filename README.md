This is a MUI-Inspired, custom implemented React app to manage your fame :star:

## Nice things to try
- Dragging/reordering profiles
- Toggling dark mode
- Changing screen size
- Refreshing the window
- Adding a new network
- Deleting all entries

## Initial task statement

The goal is to build a Social Media Dashboard based on the style guide and design resources.
It should:

- Use **TypeScript** and **React** best practices
- Be responsive and consistent
- Have hover states
- Toggle color theme to their preference
  - Persist this setting in localStorage
- Allow the cards to be rearranged (Drag & Drop) and persist the location to localStorage
- Be clean and maintainable
- Test enough where it matters

The commit history shows the progress and how each feature was built.
I added functionality such as the "add new profile" feature. 

## About

It came to me as a challenge in CodeSubmit with full proprietary rights over the code.
